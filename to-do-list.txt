- Implement some way of changing the map.
- Making sprites into spritesheets.
- Add UI, in general...
- Add menus for multiple things.
- Replace the spritesheet of the gridmap for a proper one. Or modify the current one to add details to add to the map + making a proper floor instead of relying on the background. Maybe some type of brick texture?
- When finding out how to load different configurations, make more maps. 5 in total should be fine.
